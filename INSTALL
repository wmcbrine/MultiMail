MultiMail compilation and installation procedure
================================================

These instructions assume that you're compiling MultiMail from source. For
precompiled binaries, see the README files that accompany them instead.

1. Make sure any needed packages are installed --
    In addition to the MultiMail package itself, you'll also need InfoZip
    or PKZIP (and/or LHA, ARJ, etc.) to uncompress the packets and
    compress the replies. InfoZip is available from:

    http://info-zip.org/

    (PKZIP is the default for DOS; InfoZip is the default for other
    platforms.) The programs should be installed somewhere in the PATH;
    otherwise, the full path must be specified in ~/.mmailrc.

    To compile MultiMail, you'll need curses -- either ncurses, SysV
    curses (e.g., Solaris curses), or PDCurses. You can get ncurses from:

    http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

    PDCurses is available at:

    http://pdcurses.org/

    (If you're using Linux, odds are that you already have ncurses and
    InfoZip.) Also, bear in mind that MultiMail needs the C++ standard 
    libraries, not just C.

    If using PDCurses, MultiMail now requires version 3.1 or later.

    The 16-bit MS-DOS port also uses Ralf Brown's SPAWNO library:

    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub/WWW/files.html

2. Configure it (for compilation) --
    Check the options and paths in the Makefile. If your curses header
    file is not in /usr/include/curses.h, change CURS_INC and/or
    CURS_DIR as appropriate. If the curses library is not in the linker's
    search path, specify the directory in CURS_LIB.

3. Compile MultiMail --
    At the base directory, type: make

4. Run it --
    Type: ./mm
    (For DOS, OS/2 or Win32, set the MMAIL or HOME variable, then run mm.)

5. (Optional:) Configure it (for end user) --
    Edit the ~/.mmailrc file. (For DOS, OS/2 or Win32, mmail.rc.)

6. (Optional:) Install it system-wide --
    Type: make install
    to install the manual and binary under /usr/local
    (requires root access). (This doesn't work in DOS, OS/2 or Win32.)

See the man page (mmail.1) and README for more information.

This package includes some example color schemes, in the "colors"
directory. How or whether you install these is up to you. (If you want to
use them, I suggest putting them in your "mmail" directory. To select one,
alter the "ColorFile" keyword in .mmailrc to point to it.)


Support for XCurses (PDCurses)
==============================

When MultiMail is compiled with XCurses, you can use the X resource
database to set certain startup options. Here are some example resources:

XCurses*normalFont:	9x15
XCurses*boldFont:	9x15bold
XCurses*lines:		30
XCurses*cols:		80

For details, see the PDCurses documentation.

If you're using a non-X text editor with an XCurses version of MultiMail,
it will work better if you set MultiMail's editor variable to "xterm -e
$EDITOR" instead of just "$EDITOR" (the default).


Compile notes: Win32, MS-DOS, and OS/2
======================================

In the MultiMail source, separate makefiles are provided for these ports.

Makefile.dj -  DJGPP (32-bit MS-DOS)
Makefile.tcc - Turbo C++ (16-bit MS-DOS)
Makefile.mng - MinGW (Win32)
Makefile.wat - Watcom (All platforms -- Win32 by default)
Makefile.msv - Microsoft Visual C++ (Win32)

Edit the appropriate makefile to point to your installation of PDCurses,
and compile with, e.g.:

 make -f Makefile.mng

(Use "wmake" instead of "make" for Watcom; "nmake" for MSVC.)
